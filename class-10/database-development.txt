Steps to create Database in Mysql:
--------------------------------------
We can create Database in two ways:
1.) By executing a simple query.
2.) By using forward engineering in Mysql Workbench.


1.) By executing a simple query.
-----------------------------------
Lets assume that we need to create a Database with the name movies.
We can do that by executing the below query:

CREATE DATABASE movies;
or 
CREATE SCHEMA movies;

optimizing our Database creation query:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS movies;

Note:
A single Mysql server can have multiple Databases.
Here IF NOT EXISTS let's us instruct the MySQL server to check the existence 
of a Database with a similar name prior to creating a Database.

When IF NOT EXISTS is used then Database is created only if given name doesn't 
conflict with an existing Database's name.
if we try to create a Database with already available name then Mysql server will throw error.
eg:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE movies;
ERROR 1007 (HY000): Can't create database 'movies'; database exists

Collation :
---------------
Collation is  a set of rules used in comparison.
In mysql data is stored by using specific character set.
so here character set can be defined at different levels like server,database, table and column.

We need to select the rules of collation which in turn depend on the character set chosen.

for eg:
The Latin1 character set uses the latin1_swedish_ci collation which is the Swedish case insensitive order.

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS movies CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;

The best practice while using local language like english, arabic, chinese etc is to select Unicode (utf-8)
character set which has flexibility of several collations or just stick to default collation utf8-general-ci.

We can see the list of existing databases by following command:
> SHOW DATABASES;

Creation of TAbles in Mysql:
-------------------------------
Below command/statment can be used to create tables in MySQL:
CREATE TABLE <table_name>;

or 
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] `TableName' (`fieldname` dataType  [optional parameters]) ENGINE = storage Engine;

In the above statement:
"CREATE TABLE" -> it is the one which is responsible for creation of table in the database.
"[IF NOT EXISTS]" --> It is optional and it only creates the table if no matching table is found.
"`fieldName`" --> It is the name of the fields (coulmn).
"data Type" --> it defines the nature of the data to be stored in the field .

"[Optional parameters]" --> addtional information about a field such as "AUTO_INCREMENT"
Lets create a table:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `PyFlixDB`.`Members` (`membership_number` INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
 `full_names` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL, 
`gender` VARCHAR(6), 
`date_of_birth` DATE,
 `physical_address` VARCHAR(255),
  `postal_address` VARCHAR(255),
`contact_number` VARCHAR(50),
 `email` VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY(`membership_number`))  ENGINE = InnoDB;



  2.) By using forward engineering in Mysql Workbench:
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Mysql Workbench provides a facility called forward engineering .
  forward engineering is a technical term to describe the process of translating a logical model
  into a physical implementation automatically.

  We already have EER diagram for PyFlix Database, so now we are going to use that EER model to generate
  SQL scripts that will create our database.

  steps:
  1. Open the EER model of PyFlix database that we have created earlier.
  2. Click on database menu 
  3. select forward engineering.
  4. IN the next window, allows us to connect to an instance of MYsql server. Click
    on the stored connection drop down list and select localhost . Click execute.

  5.
