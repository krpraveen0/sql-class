What is Database ?
A Database is a systematic collection of data.
Example: phone directory, billing database.

Types of Database:
Most popular types of database are:
    1. Distributed Database.
    2. Relational Database.
    3. Object-Oriented Database.
    4. Centralized Database.
    5. Open-source Database.
    6. Cloud Database.
    7. Data warehouses
    8. NoSQL databases.
    9. Graph Database.
    10. OLTP database.
    11. Personal database.
    12. Multimodal database.
    13. Document/Json databse.
    14. Hierarchial 
 
1. Distributed Database.
------------------------------
A distributed database is a type of database that has contributions from the common database 
and information captured by local computers. 
In this type of database system, the data is not in one place and is distributed at various organizations.

2. Relational databases:
-------------------------
This type of database defines database relationships in the form of tables. 
It is also called Relational DBMS, which is the most popular DBMS type in the market.
Database example of the RDBMS system include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server database.

3. Object-oriented databases:
---------------------------------
This type of computers database supports the storage of all data types. 
The data is stored in the form of objects. 
The objects to be held in the database have attributes and methods that define what to do with the data. 
PostgreSQL is an example of an object-oriented relational DBMS.

4. Centralized database:
---------------------------
It is a centralized location, and users from different backgrounds can access this data. 
This type of computers databases store application procedures that help users access the data even from a remote location.

5. Open-source databases:
--------------------------
This kind of database stored information related to operations. 
It is mainly used in the field of marketing, employee relations, customer service, of databases.

6. Cloud databases:
----------------------
A cloud database is a database which is optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. 
There are so many advantages of a cloud database, some of which can pay for storage capacity and bandwidth. 
It also offers scalability on-demand, along with high availability.

7. Data warehouses:
----------------------
Data Warehouse is to facilitate a single version of truth for a company for decision making and forecasting. 
A Data warehouse is an information system that contains historical and commutative data from single or multiple sources. 
Data Warehouse concept simplifies the reporting and analysis process of the organization.

8. NoSQL databases:
-------------------
NoSQL database is used for large sets of distributed data. 
There are a few big data performance problems that are effectively handled by relational databases. 
This type of computers database is very efficient in analyzing large-size unstructured data.

9. Graph databases:
---------------------
A graph-oriented database uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. 
These kinds of computers databases are mostly used for analyzing interconnections. 
For example, an organization can use a graph database to mine data about customers from social media.

10. OLTP databases:
---------------
OLTP another database type which able to perform fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments.

11. Personal database:
-----------------------
A personal database is used to store data stored on personal computers that are smaller and easily manageable. 
The data is mostly used by the same department of the company and is accessed by a small group of people.

12. Multimodal database:
------------------------
The multimodal database is a type of data processing platform that supports multiple data models that define how the certain knowledge and information in a database should be organized and arranged.

13. Document/JSON database:
-------------------------
In a document-oriented database, the data is kept in document collections, usually using the XML, JSON, BSON formats. 
One record can store as much data as you want, in any data type (or types) you prefer.

14. Hierarchical:
---------------
This type of DBMS employs the "parent-child" relationship of storing data. 
Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. 
The windows registry used in Windows XP is a hierarchical database example.

15. Network DBMS:
----------------
This type of DBMS supports many-to-many relations. 
It usually results in complex database structures. 
RDM Server is an example of database management system that implements the network model.

Components of Database:
---------------------
There are five main components of database:
    1) Hardware
    2) Software
    3) Data 
    4) procedure
    5) Data access language. (SQL , NoSQL)

1) Hardware
-------------
It provides the interface between computer and real world system.

2.) Software:
------------------
These are group of programs used to control the complete database.
This includes:
    1) The database software itself.
    2) Operating system.
    3) Network software used to share data among the users and application programs for accessing data in the database.

3.)Data
----------------
It is raw and unorganized facts that needs to be processed to make it meaningfull.
Data comprises of facts, observations, perceptions, number, character,symbols, images etc.

4.) Procedure:
-----------------
It contains the rules and regulations which helps us to use the DBMS.

5.) Data access language:
-----------------------------
It helps to access the data to and from the databse.
Special commands are written and submitted to the database known as query.
Those query returns the data from the database or make some changes the data already present in the database.


Database Management system
--------------------------------
IT is software(collection of programs) which enables us to access
databases, manipulate data, report and represent data.
It also helps to control access to databases.

DBMS was implemented first time in the 1960s.
Integrated Data Store(IDS) is the first DBMS by Charles Bachman's

History of DBMS:
-------------------
1960 - first DBMS system.
1970 - Codd introduced IBM's Information Management System(IMS)
1976 - Entity-relationship model defined by Peter Chen.
1980 - Relational model database component widely accepted .
1985 - Object-oriented DBMS develops.
1990 - Incorporation of object-oriented in relational DBMS.
1991 - MS access by Microsoft (personal DBMS).
1995 - First Internet Database application.
1997 - XML is being used in database processing.

advantages of DBMS:
----------------------
1. It offers a variety of techniques to store & retrieve data.
2. It serves as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data.
3. Uniform administration procedures for data.
4. Application programmers never exposed to details of data representation and storage.
5. A DBMS uses various powerful functions to store and retrieve data efficiently.
6. Offers Data Integrity and Security.
7. The DBMS implies integrity constraints to get a high level of protection against prohibited access to data.
8. A DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that only one user can access the same data at a time.
9. Reduced Application Development Time.

Some of the disadvantages of DBMS:
---------------------------------------
1. Increases the budget of the organization .
2. Training required to use DBMS.
3. Database may corrupt which results in data loss.
4. It can't perform sophisticated calculations.


 SQL
 -----------
 It stands for structured query language.
 It is used to perform different operations like insert,
 search,update,delete etc on relational database.


 formally,
 SQL is a language to operate databases. 
 It includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc. 
 SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard language. 
 SQL standards are divided into several parts. i.e 

                Part 1 - SQL/Framework	                It offers logical concepts.
                Part 2 - SQL/Foundation	                It includes central elements of SQL.
                Part 3 - SQL/CLI	                    This standard includes central elements of SQL.
                Part 4 - Persistent Stored Modules	    Stored routines, external routines, and procedural language extensions to SQL.
                Part 9 - Management of External Data	Adds syntax and definitions to SQL/Foundation, which allow SQL access to non-SQL data sources (files).
                Part 10 - Object Language Bindings	    Object Language Bindings: This part specifies the syntax and semantics of embedding SQL in Javaâ„¢.
                Part 11 - SQL/Schema	                Information and Definition Schemas
                Part 12 - SQL/Replication	            This project began in 2000. This part helps to define the syntax and semantics to allow the definition of replication schemes and rules.
                Part 13 - Java Routines and Type	    Java Routines and Types: This part of routines using the Java Programming Language.
                Part 14 - SQL/XML	                    SQL and XML
                Part 15 - SQL/MDA	                    Provide SQL support for Multi-Dimensional Arrays

 It is also used maintain the relational databases.
 Example: Mysql, Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL etc.

 NOte : SQL syntaxes used in different RDBMS are almost similar, at the
 same time few RDBMS uses a few different commands and even proprietary(ownership)
 SQL syntaxes.

 SQL is used 
    to access data in the RDBMS.
    to describe the data.
    to define the data in a database and manipulate the specific data.
    to create and drop database tables.
    to use the functions in db, create a view and stored procedure.
    to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.



SQL process 
Some of important components of SQL process are:
    1. SQL Query Engine.
    2. Optimization Engines.
    3. Query Dispatcher.
    4. Classic Query Engine.

Note : A classic query engine allows us to manage all the 
non-SQL queries.

Installation of PostgreSQL(pgadmin), Mysql(workbench),ibm db2, aws rdbms.

Important elements of SQL language:
------------------------------------------
Keywords: specail words whose meaning is already defined by the sql engine.
            Each statement in Sql contains one or more Keywords.

Identifiers: any names of objects in database such as use, Ids, tables , columns etc .

Strings : it can be literal strings or Expressions with VARCHAR or CHAR datatypes.

Expressions: statement formed by using several elements like constants , SQL operators, column names and subqueries.

Search Conditions: These are used to select a subset of the rows of a table or used to control the statement like
                    an IF statement to determine the control of flow.

Special Values: Those are used in Expressions and as column defaults when building tables.

Variables : whose value can vary time to time (local Variables, global Variables) .

Comments: it is used to attach explanatory text to SQL statements or blocks of statements. 
            Actaully database server doesn't execute the comments.

NULL values: Whenever value is unknown, missing or not applicable of a particular entity in sql then NULL is used.


To work with SQL engine we need to give some command so that it can perfrom some operations on the data in the database.
Those commands are known as SQL statements or Query.

Basically there are five types of widely used SQL queries :

1) Data Definition Language(DDL).
2) Data Manipulation language(DML).
3) Data Control language(DCL).
4) Transaction Control language(TCL).
5) Data Query Language (DQL).


Some of the most comman SQL commands are:
1. CREATE - defines the database structure or schema.
2. INSERT - inserts data into rows of a table.
3. UPDATE - updates data in database.
4. DELETE - removes one or more rows from a table.
5. SELECT - selects the attribute based on the Conditions described by the WHERE Clause.
6. DROP - removes tables and databases.

How SQl defines the database?
SQl defines database as a collection of tables that store a detailes set of structured data.
It is table that contains a collection of rows, referred as records or tuples.
and columns are referred as attributes of that table.
Now each column in a table is designated to store a specific type of information.
for example : names, date, id, amount , salary etc.

What is Database Design?
----------------------------
-> collection of processes which facilitates the designing, development and implementation 
and maintainance of enterprise data management system.
If we design a proper datasbase then those database are:
    1) easy to maintain.
    2) improves the data consistency.
    3) are cost effective in terms of disk storage.


It is the responsibility of the database designer to decide how the data elements correlate 
and what data must be store.

objective of database design in DBMS:
---------------------------------------
to produce logical and physical design models of the proposed database system.

Here the logical mode concentrates on the data requirement and the data to be stored 
independent to the physical consideration. It doesn't concern itself with how the data will be stored
or where it will be stored physically.

Also here physical data design model involves translating the logical database design onto physical media
using Hardware resources and software systems such as DBMS.

Why Database Design is important?
IMportance of Database Design.
------------------------------------
It helps to produce an efficient & cost effictive database system that:
    1) meets the requirement of the users.
    2) high performance.


Database development life cycle:
------------------------------------
1.) requirement analysis
---------------------------
        i) Planning.
        ii) System Definition.

2.) Database designing:
-----------------------
        i) Logical model 
        ii) physical model.

3.) implementation:
------------------------
        i) Data conversion and loading.
        ii) Testing.

Database Designing techniques:
---------------------------------
There are two types of Database designing techniques:
1.) Normalization.
2.) E R modeling .

Normalization:
--------------------
It is a database design techniques that reduces data redundancy and eliminates 
the undesirable characterstics like insertion, Update, deletion anomalies.

Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them 
using relationships.
The purpose of Normalization in SQL is to eliminate reduntant(repetitive) data
and ensure data is stored logically.

the theory of Normalization of data  was purposed by the inventor of relational model 'Edgar Codd'.
he started theory of Normalization with introduction of the First normal Form.
and he continued to extend this theory with Second and third normal form.

Later he accompanied Raymond F. Boyce to develop the theory of Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

Normalization theory deals with the followings:
----------------------------------------------------
1) 1NF(First Normal Form)
2) 2NF(Second Normal Form).
3) 3NF(Third Normal Form).
4) BCNF(Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
5) 4NF.
6) 5NF.
7) 6NF.

Note : The theory of DAta Normalization in mysql server is still being developed further.
For example, there is a discussion even on 6th normal form.
However, in most practical application, Normalization achives its best in 3rd Normal Form.

POC of Normalization:
---------------------
Let us assume a video library that maintains a database of movies rented out.
Here without any Normalization in database all the information is stored in the single table.



1) 1NF(First Normal Form):
--------------------------------
Normalization 1NF tells that:
1.) Each table cell should contain a single value.
2.) Each record needs to be unique.

Key in SQL?
-------------
A key in SQL is a value used to identify records(rows) in a table uniquely.

A SQL key can be a single column or combination of multiple coulumns used to uniquely identify rows or tuples in the table.

SQL key is used to identify duplicate information as well as it also helps to establish a relationship 
between multiple tables in the database.

Note: Columns in a table that are not used to identify a record uniquely are called non-key columns.

Primary Key:
-----------------
A Primary key is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely.

Primary key follows following attributes:
---------------------------------------------

1.) A primary key cannot be NULL.
2.) A primary key value must be unique .
3.) A primary key value should rarely be changed.
4.) The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted.

HW:
------
composite key?
Design a database for movies_rental excel table.
Populate that with dummy values.

What composite key?
It is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely.

Let us consider a database where two students having same name but living at different address.
Hence we can use both name and address to identify each of the students(records) uniquely by the help of composite key.
Here the name and address columns are being used to form a composite key.

2NF(second normal form) Rules:
------------------------------
1) IT  is should obey all rules of first normal form. or It should be first normal form.
2) single column Primary key that does not functionally dependent on any subset of candidate key relation.
NOte: every non-key attribute is fully dependent on primary key.
It is clear that we can't move forward to make our simple database in second normalization form unless we partition the table.
This two NF form  eliminates partial dependencies on primary key.
