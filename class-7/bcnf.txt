BCNF :
--------------
When our table is in 3NF and further some dpendency remains there then we should go for BCNF.
It was proposed by two person's boyce & codde so the theory named as Boyce-Codd normal form.
If our database is in 3NF, still there is some anomalies due to presence of more than one candidate key in the table.
so in that case we need to use advance version of 3NF which is known as BCNF. Sometimes BCNF is also referred as 3.5NF.

Important points on BCNF:
----------------------------------
It is advance version of 3NF, it is stricter than 3NF.
A table which is in BCNF if every functional dpendency X -> Y, X is the super key of the table.
For a table to be in BCNF it should be in 3NF,
and for every functional dpendency, Left hand side should be the super key.
