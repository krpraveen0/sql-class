2NF:
--------
It rectifies the parial dependency of a table.
which means if a certian column values are going to partially depend on other column then it is known as partial
dependency.


What is Foreign Key:
-----------------------
The key which references the primary key of some other table is known as Foreign key.
It helps to connect different tables.

Important points of Foreign key:
---------------------------------
A foreign key can have different name from its primary key.
In ensures that rows in one talble have corresponding rows in another table as well.
Unlinke primary key, Foreign key do not have to be unique, mostly they aren't.

Why do you need a foreign key?

To achieve and maintain referential integrity.

Transitive functional dependencies:
----------------------------------------
if a non-key column changed then it might be possible that due to it other non-key column changes its value.

3NF(Third Normal Form)
-------------------------
The 3NF theory states that:

    1. It should be in 2NF.
    2. It should not have any transitive functional dependencies.

We need to divide our table again so that we can move 2NF table to 3NF.
Majorly for simple database we cannot decompose those higher than normalization form of 3NF.
But for complex databases we can decompose further also in BCNF Normal Form.
